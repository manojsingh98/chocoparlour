In 2021, I developed a user interface that I recently rediscovered in an old folder.
Back then, I hadn't yet started sharing my projects on GitHub. Upon finding this piece of work, I decided it's time to publish it on GitHub.
This UI represents a snapshot of my skills and creativity from that period, and by sharing it on GitHub, I showcase my progress over time.
